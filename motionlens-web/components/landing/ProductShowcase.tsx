// Nineteen landing-page module cards.
//
// Why card clicks no longer link directly to bare module routes:
//   A bare URL like /orthopedic/trendelenburg carries no ?patientId=,
//   so usePatientContext returns isDoctorFlow=false and the entire
//   save / banner / history surface stays hidden — even for a
//   logged-in doctor. The audit showed this was the *only* difference
//   between the dashboard path and the landing path.
//
// The fix: route the visitor through the existing dashboard flow so
// the patientId is attached to the URL the same way it always is.
// Each card stashes its *intended module route* in sessionStorage
// before redirecting; the patient list page reads that key on the
// next patient-card click and forwards straight to
//   <module>?patientId=<id>
// — skipping the patient-profile page so the doctor lands on the
// module they actually picked. If sessionStorage is empty (normal
// dashboard usage), the patient list keeps its existing
// behaviour (open the profile).
//
//   - Not signed in  → /auth/signin?next=/dashboard/patients
//                      (SignInForm already honours `next` and routes
//                       there after login; intendedModule survives
//                       the round-trip since it's per-tab.)
//   - Signed in      → /dashboard/patients  → patient click
//                      → /<module>?patientId=<id>
//
// No other file is touched — usePatientContext, SaveToPatientButton,
// the capture components, the patient profile, and every backend
// endpoint are all unchanged.
